UI & UX:

Display warning for certain action, e.g. failed to log in, repeated email for register or etc.

Implemented alt-text for all non-text content in order to improve the Perceivability.

Text contrast is strong and apparent between photo and texts on the photo.

Implemented header, section, and footer in order to improve the operability.

Implemented Proper page navigation, ie: tab can select next option on the page, 'back to top page' button for scrolling back to top of page.

Implemented onSubmit on forms rather than onClick submit button, so form can be submitted by using enter key on the keyboard, which improves UX on phone or tablet etc.

Implemented link tags for better understandability for navigation.
